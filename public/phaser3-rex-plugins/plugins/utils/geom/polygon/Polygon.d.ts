 * A Polygon object
 * 
 * The polygon is a closed shape consists of a series of connected straight lines defined by list of ordered points.

 * It is not a Game Object, in that you cannot add it to the display list, and it has no texture.
 * To render a Polygon you should look at the capabilities of the Graphics class.

     * This module implements a modified ear slicing algorithm, optimized by z-order curve hashing and extended to
     * handle holes, twisted polygons, degeneracies and self-intersections in a way that doesn't guarantee correctness
     * of triangulation, but attempts to always produce acceptable results for practical data.
     * 
     * Example:
     * 
     * ```javascript
     * const triangles = Polygon.Earcut([10,0, 0,50, 60,60, 70,10]); // returns [1,0,3, 3,2,1]
     * ```
     * 
     * Each group of three vertex indices in the resulting array forms a triangle.
     * 
     * ```javascript
     * // triangulating a polygon with a hole
     * earcut([0,0, 100,0, 100,100, 0,100,  20,20, 80,20, 80,80, 20,80], [4]);
     * // [3,0,4, 5,4,0, 3,4,7, 5,0,1, 2,3,7, 6,5,1, 2,7,6, 6,1,2]
     * 
     * // triangulating a polygon with 3d coords
     * earcut([10,0,1, 0,50,2, 60,60,3, 70,10,4], null, 3);
     * // [1,0,3, 3,2,1]
     * ```
     * 
     * If you pass a single vertex as a hole, Earcut treats it as a Steiner point.
     * 
     * If your input is a multi-dimensional array (e.g. GeoJSON Polygon), you can convert it to the format
     * expected by Earcut with `Polygon.Earcut.flatten`:
     * 
     * ```javascript
     * var data = earcut.flatten(geojson.geometry.coordinates);
     * var triangles = earcut(data.vertices, data.holes, data.dimensions);
     * ```
     * 
     * After getting a triangulation, you can verify its correctness with `Polygon.Earcut.deviation`:
     * 
     * ```javascript
     * var deviation = earcut.deviation(vertices, holes, dimensions, triangles);
     * ```
     * Returns the relative difference between the total area of triangles and the area of the input polygon.
     * 0 means the triangulation is fully correct.
     * 
     * For more information see https://github.com/mapbox/earcut
     * @param data A flat array of vertex coordinate, like [x0,y0, x1,y1, x2,y2, ...]
     * @param holeIndices An array of hole indices if any (e.g. [5, 8] for a 12-vertex input would mean one hole with vertices 5–7 and another with 8–11).
     * @param dimensions The number of coordinates per vertex in the input array (2 by default). Default 2.
